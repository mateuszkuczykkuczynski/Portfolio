# Portfolio
This app will be my portfolio website build in React. 
As backend developer i would like to improve my frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JS, React/Vue) to become a fullstack developer in a future. 
It will be my first project using React so it can be (more likely will be) not the best one but efforts count right? RIGHT!? 
App will be hosted on Github Pages.
More info/ updates soon! 

28.08.2023 Update
